The Production folder contains compiled CSS files.

The Development folder contains LESS files,
but you will need a local server (like WAMP) for the less.js parser to work.

The Extended compatibility folder contains the
alternative grid (without CSS calc, for older browsers and Safari 6) "alt-core.css" file and the IE8 compatible version.

Be sure to give the Documentation a read!
